  <h1><strong><em>What is New World?</em></strong></h1>
  <p>New World is an open world MMORPG in which you play a custom character of your own making.
    This character uses various weapons, items and abilities to battle forces of nature and Corruption.
    This "Corruption" is the main anatagonist in the game and is gradually taking control of all
    living things in the natural world.
  </p>
  <p>You begin your journey on a ship at sea. soon in the prologue the ship is sunk by a major storm
    and you are left stranded on a beach to fend for yourself. find matirials to craft items nessessary
    for survival and best of luck in the brave <strong>New World</strong>!

  <h2><strong>Crafting Guide: Armorworking</strong></h2>
  <p>Everyone loves the feeling of walking around the main city in a game blazed in your newly obtained
    resplendant glitening in the sunlight armor set! We have all felt that from time to time, at least
    until someone ten levels higher than you shows up and calls you a noob. ah the <em>ah the good old days!</em>
  </p>
  <h3>Things of little importance</h3>
  <p>As this game is brand new there are difficulties in getting to play it.
    absurd amounts of players searge the servers every night and make is seemingly impossible to get in,
    the servers you see only allow a certain limit of players in and the login que <strong>only moves if a player logs out.</strong>
    See the dilemma? Once people finally get into the game they decide it is a good idea to <em>trick the system into thinking they are still online.</em>
    How do they do this? you might ask. well <strong>they auto run into walls and leave the game running all day!</strong>
    which essentially makes it impossible to get into the game since que never move. Brilliant design.
